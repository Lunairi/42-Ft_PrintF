# 42-Ft_PrintF
First algorithm branch project: Recreating printf functionality. Completed November 18, 2017.

Day 1 progress (about 8 hours)
- Completed: s d i o u x c X %% p - minwidthfield
- Incomplete: hh h l ll j z [SDOUC (ls ld lo lu lc)]
- In Progress: precision + 0 # space

Day 2 progress (about 8 hours)
- Completed: s d i o u x c X %% p - minwidthfield hh h l ll j z [SDOUC (ls ld lo lu lc)] + 0 # space
- Incomplete: precision

Completed printf without precision or bonuses. This was mostly a project to see how much I've matured in terms of being able to create and implement algorithm, and to continue down the algorithm branch onto more advance subjects to further my algorithm skills. It took about 16 hours to write this printf and handles all of the above modifiers. Repo testing continuously on http://ftprintf.com/
